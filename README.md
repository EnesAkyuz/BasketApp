## Overview

The platform leverages blockchain technology to facilitate secure and transparent peer-to-peer transactions using VET coin as the primary cryptocurrency. Basket's unique selling point is its focus on sustainability, offering rewards to users who engage in eco-friendly transactions like saving meals, and expiring products.

Our team conceptualized and developed Basket as part of a hackathon, aiming to address the need for a decentralized, user-friendly marketplace tailored specifically for campus environments. The platform integrates smart contract functionality to ensure seamless and trustworthy exchanges between users, while also promoting sustainable practices through its innovative reward system.

By combining the power of Web3 technology with a focus on campus life and sustainability, Basket aims to create a more connected, efficient, and environmentally conscious ecosystem for educational institutions.

## Problem

#### Can we, as students, eliminate food waste?

As students, we've observed that a considerable amount of edible food is discarded daily in cafeterias, dormitories, and student apartments. This waste occurs due to various factors such as overbuying, improper storage, or simply forgetting about perishables. 

Moreover, there's a lack of incentive for students to actively participate in reducing food waste. This not only contributes to environmental issues but also represents a missed opportunity for resource optimization and community building among students who could benefit from shared meals or ingredients.
